"""No value may be computed from a window that holds a missing input (#1463).

``Registry.compute`` masks the bar a dependency is missing on, not the bars
after it. An alpha that turns a comparison into 0/1, calls ``.where(cond, 0)``
or takes ``np.fmax`` over a missing side substitutes a constant for the missing
input, and every later bar whose window reaches back to the gap then carries a
value that bar never supported.

Oracle: remove one symbol's dependencies on one bar, then perturb the same bar
up and down. A later cell of that symbol whose value moves with the perturbation
depends on the bar, so it must be NaN when the bar is missing. The panel is
dyadic (prices in sixteenths, integer volume) and differences are compared with a
tight tolerance, so pandas' online rolling sums carry no rounding residue that
would read as a dependence.

A stateful statistic (``.ewm(alpha=m/n, adjust=False)``, a running product) is
held to a different rule, decided on #1463: it skips the missing observation and
continues from its last state, so the bars after a gap carry a value computed
from the observations it saw. No shipped alpha uses one in this build — the
A-share smoothers that did are gone — so the rule lives in ``src.factors.base``'s
NaN policy rather than in a test here.

Two alphas the sweep still flags — ``alpha101_013`` and ``alpha101_016``, both
``rank(ts_cov(rank(x), rank(y), 5))`` — are the oracle's own artifact, not a
dependence: their flagged cells sit 10 to
241 bars past a 5-bar window, every one is a cross-sectional rank moving by
exactly 1/48 or 1/24, and the covariances agree to twelve decimals between the
two perturbed runs. Percentile ranks (k/24) are not dyadic, so the rolling
covariance carries a rounding residue that breaks a tie differently.

The perturbation oracle has a blind spot, found on 2026-09-21: a comparison
gate (``m20 < h``, ``(lhs < rhs).astype(float)``) does not move when the gap bar
moves by a tick, so a gate that reads a missing operand as "not less" looked
independent of the bar while it emitted a constant for the whole window. The
second oracle compares the gapped run with the gap-free one instead: a cell after
the gap that is finite and differs from its gap-free value was computed from the
gap. It found more alphas still; two flagged cells (``alpha101_094``,
``alpha101_098``) sit 70 to 210 bars past every window and
come from correlations that differ by 1e-15 to 1e-12 between the two runs, the
same tie-breaking residue as the four above.

Those gates mask on their inputs' reach (``base.observed_over``), not on their
operands' NaN, so that a correlation that is undefined on complete data (a
constant window, common in a small universe) keeps the verdict it always had
(#1452). ``test_a_gate_keeps_its_verdict_on_complete_data`` pins that side.
